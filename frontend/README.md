I want to create an application that read the youtube video transcript.
Then what ever questions user ask related to that video that must be reponded by the application.

Build a frontend where user past the video .
Make a video player.
Model reads the video typescript.
Then user can watch video on the application
On right of it their will be box should ask you questions
where user can ask any question related to that video

Find the model that can reads the typescript of the any youtube video and fetch it.
Find the model that after fetch send that to another model that store that typescript.
And Follow up give the reponse to that user questions. (RAG System)
That shit I wanted to build.
